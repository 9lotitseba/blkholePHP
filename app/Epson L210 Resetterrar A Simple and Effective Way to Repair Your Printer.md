If you own an Epson L210 printer, you may encounter a problem where the printer's ink pads are nearing the end of their service life. This means that the printer has reached its maximum number of prints and needs to be reset. You can reset your Epson L210 printer using a software resetter (an adjustment program) that you can download for free from the internet. Here are the steps to follow:

4. Click the Select button and choose L210 as the model name. Make sure that the port is set to Auto selection. Then click OK.
5. Click the Particular adjustment mode button and select Waste ink pad counter under Maintenance. Then click OK.

7. Click the Initialization button and wait for the process to complete. This will reset the ink pad counter to zero.
8. Click the Finish button and close the program. You may need to restart your printer for the changes to take effect.
