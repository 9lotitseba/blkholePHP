ISO 11064-5:2008 is a part of the ISO 11064 series of standards that provide ergonomic principles, recommendations and requirements for the design of control centers. Control centers are places where people monitor and control complex systems, such as power plants, transportation networks, industrial processes, security systems and more.
  
Control centers are critical for the safety, efficiency and performance of these systems, and therefore require careful attention to the design of their physical environment, equipment, interfaces, work processes and organization. ISO 11064-5:2008 focuses on the layout and dimensions of workstations in control rooms and control suites.

The layout and dimensions of workstations affect the comfort, health, well-being and productivity of the operators, as well as their ability to communicate and collaborate with each other and with external parties. ISO 11064-5:2008 provides definitions, principles and methods for determining the optimal layout and dimensions of workstations based on ergonomic criteria, such as anthropometry, posture, reachability, visibility, accessibility and usability.
  
ISO 11064-5:2008 also provides examples of workstation layouts and dimensions for different types of control tasks and environments. By following the guidelines and recommendations of ISO 11064-5:2008, you can ensure that your control center meets the highest standards of ergonomics and human factors engineering, and that your operators can perform their tasks effectively, efficiently and safely.

## How to apply ISO 11064-5:2008 to your control center design project
  
ISO 11064-5:2008 provides a systematic and comprehensive process for specifying the displays and controls for your control center. The process consists of five steps:
  
1. Define the system and user requirements, such as the functions, tasks, goals, information needs, performance criteria and environmental conditions of the control center.
2. Analyze the user requirements and identify the display and control functions, such as the types, modes, levels and formats of information to be presented and manipulated by the operators.
3. Design the display and control specifications, such as the layout, dimensions, shapes, colors, symbols, labels, feedback, coding and grouping of the displays and controls.
4. Evaluate the display and control specifications, such as by testing them with representative users, scenarios and tasks, and measuring their usability, effectiveness and satisfaction.
5. Iterate the design and evaluation until the display and control specifications meet the user requirements and conform to the principles and recommendations of ISO 11064-5:2008.

ISO 11064-5:2008 also provides guidance on how to select and apply various methods and tools for each step of the process, such as user surveys, interviews, observations, task analysis, function allocation, prototyping, simulation, usability testing and more.
  
## What are the benefits of using ISO 11064-5:2008 for your control center design project
  
By using ISO 11064-5:2008 for your control center design project, you can achieve several benefits for your system, your operators and your organization. Some of these benefits are:
