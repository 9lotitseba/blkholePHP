## Linear equations and matrices
 
Linear equations are equations that involve variables and constants that are added, subtracted, or multiplied. They can be solved by using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that can be used to represent and manipulate linear equations, systems of equations, vectors, and transformations. In this book, you will learn how to use matrices to solve linear equations and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, inverse, determinant, and rank.
 
## Linear programming and transportation problems
 
Linear programming is a technique that helps to find the optimal solution for a problem that involves maximizing or minimizing a linear objective function subject to some linear constraints. Transportation problems are a special type of linear programming problems that deal with finding the optimal way of transporting goods from different sources to different destinations at the minimum cost. In this book, you will learn how to formulate and solve linear programming and transportation problems using graphical and simplex methods.
 
## Interest and annuities
 
Interest is the amount of money that is paid or received for borrowing or lending money over a period of time. It can be calculated using different methods such as simple interest, compound interest, effective interest rate, nominal interest rate, etc. Annuities are series of equal payments made at regular intervals over a specified period of time. They can be classified into different types such as ordinary annuities, annuities due, deferred annuities, perpetuities, etc. In this book, you will learn how to calculate interest and annuities using various formulas and tables.
