Pamali: Indonesian Folklore Horror - The Tied Corpse is the second episode of the Pamali series, which aims to bring Indonesian folklore and culture to the world of horror gaming. The game is developed by StoryTale Studios, an independent game studio based in Bandung, Indonesia. The studio was founded in 2017 by a group of passionate game developers who wanted to create games that reflect their own culture and identity.

The game is inspired by the concept of "pamali", which means "taboo" or "prohibition" in Indonesian. According to Indonesian beliefs, there are certain things that people should not do or say, especially in relation to the supernatural. Breaking these rules may result in bad luck, misfortune, or even death. The game explores these rules and their consequences through the lens of horror and storytelling. The game also incorporates elements of Indonesian mythology, folklore, and history, such as the legend of Nyi Roro Kidul, the queen of the south sea, and the colonial era of Indonesia.
